# Nextjs Template

This project template is supposed to allow you to quickly get started and building right away without set-up. Use it as you will ;-).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Styling

This project uses [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) for its performance and SSR capabilities built-in, which you should use with this template using `getServerSideProps` for your data if required.

## Testing

This project uses `jest` and `react-testing-library` and is ready to use. Files that sit in `__test__` folders will be testing when running the command:

```bash
yarn test
```
